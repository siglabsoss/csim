## fft_runner
The fft_runner is a simple utility that will run the 1024 sample, fixed
point FFT DSP block.
### Usage
fft_runner -f < input filename > [-s (scaled output)] [-i outputIntWidth] [-w outputWordLength]

* -f _FILE_ specify the input file, which should contain 1024 rows and two
columns. The first column being the real value and the second column being
the imaginary value of a complex sample.
* -s specify whether or not the outputs should be in scaled form (fixed point integer value).
* -i _WIDTH_ the desired bit-width of the FFT output
* -w _WIDTH_ the desired number of bits that represent the integer part
of the fixed point output (including sign bit).

## complex_gaussian
This utility simply outputs complex-valued samples generated by sampling
gaussian (normal) distributions. The output is comma separated with one
sample per row. The real part of the sample being in the first column.
### Usage
complex_gaussian -v <variance> -n <count>

* -v _VARIANCE_ the variance of the magnitude of the complex-valued samples
* -c _COUNT_ the number of sample outputs.

## filter_loopback
This application analyzes the performance of an LDPC/OFDM tx/rx chain by
looping the tx/rx chain together with an AWGN channel in between. The
application sweeps through a range of SNRs and calculates the bit error rate (BER).
### Usage
filter_loopback < path/to/config.json >
### Configuration
Below is an example JSON configuration file (with comments added for clarification)
```javascript

		"wordlen": 2304 /* codeword length of given matrices */
	},
	"ddc": {

		"up5": "../data/ddc/coeffs/up5.txt" /* relative path to digital up converter's up-by-5 FIR coefficients */
	},
	"snr": {

		"fine_incr": 0.25, /* SNR increment value when performing fine increments */
		"coarse_incr": 1.0 /* SNR increment value when performing coarse increments */
	},
	"Hf": "../data/filter_loopback/Hf.csv", /* relative path to CSV file containing H(f), which would be 1024 complex values used to reverse the linear phase delay effects of the tx/rx chains */
	"sync": {
		"delay": 1420 /* the number of time domain input samples to skip initially. this is the number of samples it takes for the time domain signal to propagate through. */
	}
}
```
## ldpc_analysis (deprecated)
This utility is used to analyze the performance of LDPC codes. This is similar to filter_loopback but it does not contain an OFDM tx/rx chain and is instead more isolated.
### Usage
There is no configuration or parameters. The source code must be tweaked to change behavior.
